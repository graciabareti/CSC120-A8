- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Start early!!! As well as grab a friend to work on the assignment as it makes things alot 
easier when you have someone to bounce ideas with as well and debug together. Since I started working with someone on homework assignments, its alleviated alot of my anxiety within this course.
